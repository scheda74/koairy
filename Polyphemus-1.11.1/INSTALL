Installation

*** Requirements ***

Polyphemus is based on three languages : C++, Fortran 77/90 and Python.

What you need to use Polyphemus :

- make or scons 0.98.5 or higher (that is ready to use from
  Polyphemus-[version]/utils);

- a decent C++ compiler,
  such as GNU G++ 3.2 or higher, or Intel icc 7.1  and 8.0;

- a Fortran 77 compiler,
  such as GNU G77 3.2 or higher or GNU GFORTRAN 4.0 or Intel IFC 7.1 or
  IFORT 8.0;

- Python 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5;

- Blitz++ 0.6 or higher;

- Blas/Lapack, any recent version;

- for other requirements (specific applications), see User's Guide.


*** Installation ***

- The first step is to download Polyphemus on
  http://cerea.enpc.fr/polyphemus/download.html or
  http://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=1173

- Expand the tar.bz2 archive.
  Under Unix or Linux, to extract it just type in command line:

     tar -jxvf Polyphemus-[version].tar.bz2

  where [version] is the latest version number of Polyphemus.
  This will create a directory named Polyphemus-[version]/.

- extract_configuration.cpp
  The library AtmoPy makes calls to a C++ program called
  extract_configuration. You need to compile it to have AtmoPy fully
  installed. To do so, go to the directory where this file is located.

     cd Polyphemus-[version]/include/atmopy/talos

  Then, you can use SCons to manage the needed compilation. Just type in
  command line:

     ../../../utils/scons.py

  Or if you don't want to use SCons:

     g++ -I../../Talos -o extract_configuration extract_configuration.cpp

  You may then need to replace g++ by your own C++ compiler.

- For all other programs, SConstruct files are provided as well as makefiles.
  Read the user's guide (in particular chapter 2) for more details.
