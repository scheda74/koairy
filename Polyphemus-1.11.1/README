*** What is Polyphemus ***

Polyphemus is a full modeling system for air quality. It is designed to yield
up-to-date simulations in a reliable framework: aerosols, data assimilation,
ensemble forecast and daily forecasts. Its completeness allows to deal with
many fields: photochemistry, heavy metals, radionuclides, etc. It is able to
handle simulations from local to continental scale.
