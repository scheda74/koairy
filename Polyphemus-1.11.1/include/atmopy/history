| ATMOPY HISTORY |
o----------------o

Version 1.8.1 (2018-04-10)
-------------

- Ported SConstruct files to the new build system.
- Added a user message when Verdandi is needed and cannot be found.
- Added error checking in configuration parsing.
- Added to "extract_configuration" an health test option '-t'.
- Disables 'TALOS_DEBUG' for "extract_configuration".
- Fixed the SConstruct files related to SWIG.

Version 1.8 (2015-04-20)
-----------

- Added the submodule "model", with a SWIG interface to 'Polair3DVerdandi'.
- Added the submodule "manager", with a SWIG interface to
  'GroundNetworkObservationManager' and 'EnsembleObservationManager'.
- Added two versions of 'Vector2::Flatten' to the submodule "manager".
- Added 'HasSameShapeDouble and 'HasSameShapeInt' to the interface to 'Vector2'.
- Added "Aircraft" observations class.
- Added Basemap functions to plot cross sections.

** Bug fixes:

- An instantiation of 'Vector3::Flatten' was missing.


Version 1.7.2 (2010-12-02)
-------------

** Bug fixes:

- AtmoPy could not be imported anymore because of an indentation error.


Version 1.7.1 (2010-11-03)
-------------

** Improvements:

- Added support for AERONET data (tropospheric column optical depth) in class
  'Station'.


Version 1.7 (2009-05-18)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added the class 'Source' with the related functions 'read_sources',
  'get_sources_coordinates', 'get_species_sources_coordinates' and
  'get_level_sources_coordinates' to display point sources.
- Added functions 'fac2', 'fac5', 'nmse_1', 'mg', 'vg' and 'fmt'. Also
  renamed 'nmse' to 'rnmse_2'.


Version 1.6 (2008-11-12)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added the ability to penalize the 2-norm of the weight vector in 'ELS' and
  'ELSd'.
- Added 'w_penalized_least_squares'.
- Added the normalized mean square error (NMSE).
- Improved the support of the default string format in 'Station': the
  latitude, the longitude and the altitude of the station may now be missing.
- Took into account an API change that occurred in Matplotlib so that
  Matplotlib 0.98.x may be supported.

** Bug fixes:

- 'segplot', 'segplot_logx' and 'segplot_date' raised an exception whatever
  their arguments may be.
- For some locations outside the domain, 'get_simulated_at_location' raised
  an exception (because of indices out of range) instead of returning an empty
  array.


Version 1.5.1 (2008-05-09)
-------------

** Bug fix:

- Fixed a bug in 'get_daily_obs_peaks' and 'get_daily_peaks': the keyword
  argument 'nb_range_min' was not properly handled and it was de facto lower
  than 2. This bug has slight consequences: the only AtmoPy code using this
  function is in 'EnsembleData'. This class has been slightly modified so that
  the results remain the same as previously.


Version 1.5 (2008-04-22)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added the learning methods
  'ExponentiatedGradientAdaptive',
  'RidgeRegressionDiscounted',
  'RidgeRegressionWindow',
  'Polynomial',
  'PolynomialGradient',
  'FixedShare',
  'FixedShareGradient',
  'VariableShareGradient',
  'OnlineNewtonStep',
  'InternalZink',
  'InternalPolynomialGradient',
  'InternalExponentiatedGradientDiscounted'
  and 'DynamicLinearRegression'.
- In ensemble methods, added support for per-station predictions, for hourly
  predictions and for learning with extended weights.
- Added bias removal in 'EnsembleMean' and 'EnsembleMedian'.
- Added 'EnsembleData.AddSimulation', 'EnsembleData.ComputeStationStatistics',
  'EnsembleData.DuplicateEnsemble' and 'EnsembleData.RankArray'.
- Added 'EnsembleMethod.ComputeStationStatistics'.
- Added the keyword argument 'states' to 'disp' and 'dispcf', so that these
  functions may display the state boundaries.
- Added the options 'open_figure', 'resolution' and 'area_thresh' to the
  function 'getm'.
- Improved 'w_least_squares' to deal with few observations.
- Added a makefile and a SConstruct file to compile
  "extract_configuration.cpp".
- Added an error message if the configuration file for visualization is not
  found.
- Added 'Station.GetClosestIndex'.
- Improved 'compute_stat_step' so that the keyword argument 'period' may be
  a list of datetime.

** Bug fixes:

- In 'ELSd', 'ELSdN' and 'BestModelStep', a complete lack of observations
  could not be handled at the first aggregation step. This bug resulted in
  raising an exception.


Version 1.4 (2007-10-09)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added access methods 'GetName', 'GetLatitude', 'GetLongitude',
  'GetAltitude', 'GetCountry', 'GetType' and 'GetNetwork' for class 'Station'.
- Added method 'FromDefaultString' for class 'Station'.
- Added option 'restricted' in 'combine_station_step'.
- Added an option so that an instance of 'Config' may launch an exception in
  case an error occurs.


Version 1.3 (2007-04-24)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added a test to check that AtmoPy is working.
- Improved the call to "extract_configuration" so that it should work under
  Windows.
- Modified 'getm' so a configuration file is not necessary anymore. Parameters
  'y_min', 'x_min', 'Delta_y', 'Delta_x', 'Ny' and 'Nx' are now keyword
  arguments.
- Added programs for ensemble forecasting.
- Added 'get_simulated_at_station_closest'.
- Added 'w_least_squares_simplex'.

** Bug fixes:

 - Map extent had an extra space step along latitude and longitude.

** Other changes:

- Moved from Numarray to NumPy.
